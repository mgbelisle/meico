      <p>Come join us for an evening of dancing and strolling down the street with Mei/Co. Dance as we
        usher in the holiday season. This evening will be a unique dance performance led by a tour guide around various
        parts of Greenleaf Ln. Each dance tells the story of a gift; a gift of joy, courage, pain, grace, loss, life,
        and of strength. The performance will end with a sunset reception outside with sâ€™mores, hot coco, and a bonfire
        to warm your toes!</p>
      <p>We hope to honor those who have walked through cancer by this presentation through the gift of dance and warm
        your hearts for the holidays by dwelling on the gifts that come in many different forms. We hope to see you on
        Greenleaf Lane on November 15th for Story Lane; The Gift.</p>
