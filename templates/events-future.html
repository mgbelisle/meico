      <p>Here to Listen 2021 is here! We are so excited to announce
        the amazing work we get to do this summer as we gather to dance,
        create, and listen. This year, we are honored to get to share
        the story of Keri Wilson, a fellow dancer and a ray of sunshine
        to all who knew her.</p>

      <p>Keri was born and raised in Omaha, Nebraska and began dancing at the age of 4. She quickly fell in love with
        the joy of movement and was at the studio everyday. Her parents, Kurt and Melinda Halvorson, supported Keri in
        her dancing and beyond. They were a constant presence and support in her life that inspired and encouraged
        others. During her college years at Texas Christian University, Keri became the president of the student dance
        organization, Calling in Action. After graduation, she joined Ingredients Dance Company in Dallas TX. and danced
        with the company for two years. Soon after this, while living in Florida, Keri met and married the love of her
        life, Corey Wilson. During this time, Keri began developing severe migraines. A new job for Corey took the
        newlyweds to Albuquerque, NM. Keri quickly found Dance Quest, the perfect studio for her to teach at and share
        her love for dance. The teachers and dancers there became her dance family in her final days. Unfortunately,
        Keri's migraines worsened. A doctor finally ordered an MRI and discovered that she had a very large brain tumor.
        After many tests, she had brain surgery in which they removed 99% of the tumor. Keri was then diagnosed with a
        rare form of stage 4 brain cancer called Glioblastoma. The average life expectancy for Glioblastoma is 15-16
        months. There is currently no cure. Keri continued to teach dance until the end of that year, but by this time
        the tumor returned aggressively. She declined quickly throughout the winter of 2018. Keri passed away on April
        18, 2018. Corey described Keri in her last moments "with joy on her face, knowing where she was going. She
        finished well." Her love for the Lord and the joy she spread are missed by so many. Those who had the privilege
        of knowing Keri will always remember her as, "Sunshine Personified."</p>
      <p>Come join us this summer as we dance this inspiring story of life, death, and the legacy of joy left behind.
