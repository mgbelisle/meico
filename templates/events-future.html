	Our work this year seeks to honor two neighbors, Chris and Sharon, who have lost loved ones to cancer. Part of the performance will be in their very front yards as we tell pieces of their stories. Our hope this year is to bring the community together to offer our support and love in recognition of their loss. The holidays are always a difficult time for those who have lost loved ones, so we want to take time to reflect on some of the memories that holidays stir up and just be here to listen. Our hope is that this is a time of fun and reflection in the midst of pain and loss. At the end of the show, we will wrap up with a bonfire and smores!
