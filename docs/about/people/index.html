	    </h4>
	    <p>
	      <p>Meggie Belisle began her dance training at Suzanne’s School of Dance in College Station, Texas. She has danced with Ingredients Dance Company in Texas (2008-2010), Arise Dance Company in the The Netherlands and England (2012), Roxey Ballet in New Jersey (2013-2014), and during her time in New York she worked with The Next Stage Project (2014-2015),  Awakening Movement (2014-2016), Atmosphere (2017), and is now currently a member of Ad Deum Dance Company in Houston, TX. Meggie has also choreographed for and performed in the music videos Trace the Lines by Lizi Bailey and Summertime Anytime by Dannah. Other choreographic credits include works for Talitha Dance Company and You Are Conference in Texas (2008-current), Freedom Benefit Concerts in Texas (2009), Arise Dance Company European Tour throughout the The Netherlands and England (2012), HATCH showcase in New York (2016), Amalgamate Artist Series in New York (2016), and more.</p>
<p>Meggie graduated from Belhaven University with a BFA in modern dance in 2013. Because she strongly values solid professional dance training and education, Meggie founded the KDA Pre-Professional program in Poughkeepsie, NY and was the program’s director for the 2016-2017 season. This program continues to guide and train aspiring high school students who want to pursue a career in dance.</p>
<p>In 2015, Meggie founded Mei/Co. Dance with the assistance of her amazing husband and wonderful mom. From 2015-2017 the company was based in NY and functioned on a project basis. After relocating to Houston, TX, the company found a new home and began making long term plans to establish itself as a full time company. Meggie’s deepest heart desire is to bring hope and healing to the hurting through the art of dance.</p>

	    <p>
	      Christine Pinones aka “Meggie’s Mom” - wife, mother, sister, friend, nurse practitioner, and breast cancer survivor. Chris was diagnosed with breast cancer in February 2016. The next year was filled with mammograms, MRIs, ultrasounds, biopsies, doctors appointments, multiple surgeries, and oh so many road trips from College Station to MD Anderson in Houston. But, it was also filled with lots of love, laughter, family time, faith, and joy. Tom, Chris’ husband of 30 years, was her constant strength and support - he was with her through it all. Her son, Zach, and his wife Alisa were always ready to lend a hand wherever needed. And Meggie and her husband Matt, uprooted their lives in NYC to come to Texas, so Meggie could be her mom’s daily caregiver and best friend. The experiences Meggie and her mom shared brought forth the idea for Mei/Co. dance company. Chris is now on the healing / recovery side of her cancer journey. Meggie and her mom continue to be the best of friends. Chris is, and always has been, Meggie’s biggest fan. She now also provides administrative support, planning, fund raising, guidance, encouragement, constructive criticism, and prayer support to Meggie as she leads Mei/Co. dance company.
