	      Christine Pinones aka “Meggie’s Mom” - wife, mother, sister, friend, nurse practitioner, and breast cancer survivor. Chris was diagnosed with breast cancer in February 2016. The next year was filled with mammograms, MRIs, ultrasounds, biopsies, doctors appointments, multiple surgeries, and oh so many road trips from College Station to MD Anderson in Houston. But, it was also filled with lots of love, laughter, family time, faith, and joy. Tom, Chris’ husband of 30 years, was her constant strength and support - he was with her through it all. Her son, Zach, and his wife Alisa were always ready to lend a hand wherever needed. And Meggie and her husband Matt, uprooted their lives in NYC to come to Texas, so Meggie could be her mom’s daily caregiver and best friend. The experiences Meggie and her mom shared brought forth the idea for Mei/Co. dance company. Chris is now on the healing / recovery side of her cancer journey. Meggie and her mom continue to be the best of friends. Chris is, and always has been, Meggie’s biggest fan. She now also provides administrative support, planning, fund raising, guidance, encouragement, constructive criticism, and prayer support to Meggie as she leads Mei/Co. dance company.
