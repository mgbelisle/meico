  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>Mei/Co. Dance exists to listen. We value people and their stories. We recognize that life is a mixture of joy and pain. Our hope is to be a platform for individuals to share their journey- to paint pictures of life, of joy, of pain, of the beautiful, and of the ugly. We desire to honor those who are enduring or have endured cancer by telling their stories through dance. <a href="{{ call .URL "/about/mission/" }}">... Read more</a></p>
  <h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
  <p>Here to Listen College Station is a performance truly about and for the people of College Station. We will be sharing works based on the lives of 7 individuals who have fought cancer or are currently fighting, 6 of which are from the College Station community. <a href="{{ call .URL "/events/future/" }}">...
