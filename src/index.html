  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>Mei/Co. Dance exists to listen. We value people and their stories. We recognize that life is a mixture of joy and pain. Our hope is to be a platform for individuals to share their journey- to paint pictures of life, of joy, of pain, of the beautiful, and of the ugly. We desire to honor those who are enduring or have endured cancer by telling their stories through dance. <a href="{{ call .URL "/about/mission/" }}">... Read more</a></p>

  <p>We are thrilled to be launching Mei/Co. Dance into the Houston area! After three years of being a project based company in New York, we are beginning the transition into more ongoing work. We have plans brewing for our next season from community outreaches to national touring. <a href="{{ call .URL "/events/future/" }}">... Read more</a></p>
