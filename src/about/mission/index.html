    Mei/Co. Dance exists to listen. We value people and their stories. We recognize that life is a mixture of joy and pain. We hope to be a platform for individuals to share their legacy--to paint pictures of life, of joy, of pain, of the beautiful, and of the ugly. Our desire is to honor each individual by telling his or her story. Each of our dancers is here to become a greater part of a body, a body of moving memories. There is no greater story than that of real life. Our mission is to serve individuals or families that are enduring or have endured cancer. Wherever the journey leads, we want to walk alongside those who are walking it out. We desire to shift the focus from death to life, from suffering to significance, and to color each experience of pain and loss with truth and hope. The projects we embark on are meant to give the opportunity to create something beautiful out of what is happening instead of just accepting it. Our hope is that these projects can bring healing to the heart. We do all of this with a faith in Jesus Christ and a commitment to walking in His love with prayer.

    We come to listen. We promise to honor. We hope to heal. And we offer ourselves simply as story tellers.
