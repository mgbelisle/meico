    It has become increasingly popular for art to focus on dark themes. Though cancer is not necessarily a light and cheerful topic, we hope that our art can be a means for light to enter the stage. We do no shy away from the ugly or painful experiences of life. On the contrary, we seek to tell those very stories. We share these stories of pain with honesty, yet hope.

    Our hope rests on the fact that even darkness is as light to God. He can see beyond our pain into a hope that is indescribable. We named the company “brightness” because we believe art should radiate light.
