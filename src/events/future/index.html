      <p>A Stroll down Greenleaf Ln. with Mei/Co. Dance</p>
      <p>July 19th at 6:30pm</p>
      <p>Are you ready to get out of the house? Come join us for an evening of dancing and strolling down the street with Mei/Co. Dance. This evening will be a site specific dance performance in various locations around Greenleaf Ln. The audience will be lead down the lane to watch each performance until finally reaching a treehouse in the woods. Each dance speaks to the strength, courage, and hope of those who have battled cancer and hopes to leave the audience with a new vantage point of hope and vision for their lives.</p>
      <p>The performance will end with a light reception outside with snacks, drinks, and much needed face to face conversations.</p>
      <p>We hope to honor those who have walked through cancer by this presentation through the gift of dance.</p>
