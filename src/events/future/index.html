      <h2>Houston Launch and Prayer Party</h2>
      <p>We are thrilled to be launching Mei/Co. Dance into the Houston area! After three years of being a project based company in New York, we are beginning the transition into more ongoing work. We have plans brewing for our next season from community outreaches to national touring. If you are a dancer interested in the work and mission of Mei/Co. Dance, a caring heart in the medical field, a leader of a cancer support group or organization, or just an individual interested in finding out more about what we do or supporting our mission, please come to our Launch and Prayer Party August 19th from 5-7. We will spend the first hour of the meeting introducing Mei/Co. Dance, sharing our heart, explaining our short and long term plans, and revealing details about our upcoming performance at the end of the week. We will then take the second hour as a time of prayer over the upcoming events and overall work of Mei/Co. Feel free to come for either hour exclusively or both. We are so excited about the things ahead and can’t wait to share the heartbeat of Mei/Co. Dance with the Houston community.</p>

      <h2>Here to Listen</h2>
      <p>Here to Listen in a kick off project for Mei/Co. Dance in Houston, TX. We are excited to be back in the studio in August preparing for this first performance in Houston. The performance will be August 25th at 6pm at Redemption Church. This evening will begin with a brief reception of snacks and drinks and a short community engagement experiment. The show will be a display of old and new works and wrap up with a short talk back session. We love hearing your thoughts! Come ready for a night of bitter sweet truth and beauty. Listening is a huge part of the heartbeat of Mei/Co. Dance. We strive to be a community that takes the time to listen to people and let them know that we care. Each story is valuable, valid, and worth not only listening to, but investing in with a creative process. That’s why we want it to be know that we are Here To Listen.</p>
