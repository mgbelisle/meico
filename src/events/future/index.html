      <h2>Houston Launch and Prayer Party</h2>
      <p>We are thrilled to be launching Mei/Co. Dance into the Houston area! After three years of being a project based company in New York, we are beginning the transition into more ongoing work. We have plans brewing for our next season from community outreaches to national touring. If you are a dancer interested in the work and mission of Mei/Co. Dance, a caring heart in the medical field, a leader of a cancer support group or organization, or just an individual interested in finding out more about what we do or supporting our mission, please come to our Launch and Prayer Party August 19th from 5-7. We will spend the first hour of the meeting introducing Mei/Co. Dance, sharing our heart, explaining our short and long term plans, and revealing details about our upcoming performance at the end of the week. We will then take the second hour as a time of prayer over the upcoming events and overall work of Mei/Co. Feel free to come for either hour exclusively or both. We are so excited about the things ahead and canâ€™t wait to share the heartbeat of Mei/Co. Dance with the Houston community.</p>
