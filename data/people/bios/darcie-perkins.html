Darcie Perkins grew up dancing around her family’s dairy farm in northeastern Indiana and began her formal ballet training at twelve under Beth Bly McLeish at the New American Youth Ballet and Conservatory. She completed her B.F.A. in dance performance at Butler University in 2011 and moved to NYC upon graduation. She has studied with many ballet companies through the years, as well as modern dance choreographers Paul Taylor and Doug Varone. Since being in New York, she’s worked with different contemporary choreographers, performing at the Ailey Citigroup Theatre, Dumbo Arts Festival, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She seeks to encourage bodies and minds of all ages to discover the joy of movement and the arts through teaching dance and yoga at several YMCA’s and studios in Queens and Manhattan. She’s also spent time teaching dance and setting her own work on college students in Sydney, Australia. She is grateful for God’s blessings and constant guidance.
