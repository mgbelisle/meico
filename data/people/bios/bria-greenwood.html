Bria Greenwood, from Madison, MS, received all of her dance training from Ballet Magnificat in Jackson, MS. She was in their School of the Arts for nine years, and was in the professional Trainee Program for three years. Her last two years, she was a part of the Events Company that toured to Honduras, Guam, South Korea, and China. Bria is thankful to the Lord for this new opportunity with Ad Deum II.
