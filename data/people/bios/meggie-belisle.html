<p>In 2015, Meggie founded Mei/Co. Dance with the assistance of her amazing husband and wonderful mom. From 2015-2017 the company was based in NY and functioned on a project basis. After relocating to Houston, TX, the company found a new home and began making long term plans to establish itself as a full time company. Meggie’s deepest heart desire is to bring hope and healing to the hurting through the art of dance.</p>
